Motivation for Transfer Learning
We have already briefly discussed that humans don’t learn everything from the ground up and leverage and transfer their knowledge from previously learnt domains to newer domains and tasks. Given the craze for True Artificial General Intelligence, transfer learning is something which data scientists and researchers believe can further our progress towards AGI. In fact, Andrew Ng, renowned professor and data scientist, who has been associated with Google Brain, Baidu, Stanford and Coursera, recently gave an amazing tutorial in NIPS 2016 called ‘Nuts and bolts of building AI applications using Deep Learning’ where he mentioned,
