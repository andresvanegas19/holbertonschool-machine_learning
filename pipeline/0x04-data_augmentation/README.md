Can augmentation help even if I have lots of data?

Yes. It can help to increase the amount of relevant data in your dataset. This is related to the way with which neural networks learn. Let me illustrate it with an example.

cars ford and chevrolet in blue colors
The two classes in our hypothetical dataset. The one in the left represents Brand A (Ford), and the one in the right represents Brand B (Chevrolet).
Imagine that you have a dataset, consisting of two brands of cars, as shown above. Let’s assume that all cars of brand A are aligned exactly like the picture in the left (i.e. All cars are facing left) . Likewise, all cars of brand Bare aligned exactly like the picture in the right (i.e. Facing right) . Now, you feed this dataset to your “state-of-the-art” neural network, and you hope to get impressive results once it’s trained.
