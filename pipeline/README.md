# What Is a Machine Learning Pipeline?

A machine learning pipeline is a way to codify and automate the workflow it takes to produce a machine learning model. Machine learning pipelines consist of multiple sequential steps that do everything from data extraction and preprocessing to model training and deployment.

For data science teams, the production pipeline should be the central product. It encapsulates all the learned best practices of producing a machine learning model for the organizationâ€™s use-case and allows the team to execute at scale. Whether you are maintaining multiple models in production or supporting a single model that needs to be updated frequently, an end-to-end machine learning pipeline is a must.
